rstudio-snippets
=======

Clone this repository as a folder at `~/.R`

in the case of windows this will actually be at `~/Documents/.R`, at least
on my machine

Eg on windows do:

```
cd ~/Documents/
git clone https://github.com/dpastoor/rstudio-snippets.git .R
```

You may or may not need to remove that existing folder, if it exists, before cloning.

## extra snippets

### testing-related

I prefer the describe-style testing available in testthat, 
therefore have two snippets `ditt` and `itt` for quickly scaffolding the describe/it syntaxes
