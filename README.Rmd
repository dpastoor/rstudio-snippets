rstudio-snippets
=======

Clone this repository as a folder at `~/.R/snippets`

in the case of windows this will actually be at `~/Documents/.R/snippets`, at least
on my machine

Eg on windows do:

```
cd ~/Documents/.R
git clone https://github.com/dpastoor/rstudio-snippets.git snippets
```

You may or may not need to remove that existing folder, if it exists, before cloning.
